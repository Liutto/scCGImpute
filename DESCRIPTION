Description: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has become a powerful technique to investigate cellular heterogeneity and complexity in various fields by revealing the gene expression status of individual cells. Despite the undeniable benefits of scRNA-seq, it is not immune to its inherent limitations, such as sparsity and noise, which would hinder downstream analysis. In this paper, we introduce scCGImpute, a model-based approach for addressing the challenges of sparsity in scRNA-seq data through imputation.
